:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- Why did we introduce a decision tree at the beginning of our questionnaire?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

After introducing the name of your project and its purpose, you will enter the part of the tool that allows you to identify the relevant questions in the Software Management Plan for your project. We have constructed a decision tree that will guide you towards the minimum requirements for your SMP.

The reasoning behind the structure of the decision tree is to allow you to jump out of the process and into filling out the SMP as soon as possible. As you might notice from the figure above, the more people are involved in a project, the more complex the SMP is going to be.
With the same reasoning in mind, the least amount of people need to interact with your software, the least amount of bureaucracy you need to perform on it. THis results in a shorter and more compact SMP.


Introduce the decision tree and explain why we have chosen this structure
Funnel people to the relevant points for their project, while leaving out the points that are not (yet) relevant.
Introduce the three main questions of the decision tree.
Multi-User
Reuse
Community
Knowledge of the consequences of opening up the software to a wider use.
What is the difference between multi-user and community?
Knowledge of the consequences of reusing the software
What is essential for others to reuse software not developed by them?
When is documentation enough?
Remarkable cases:
N/N/N - One time use, simplest plan needed
N/N/Y - One time use, but may need to be made public for verification purposes? Journal request?
Y/Y/N - Closed community?
Based on the information that you gathered from the decision tree, you can now understand the scope of a project and its potential impact.
Decision tree is stored in the JSON file, not the DOCX or the Cookiecutter file.
Should the “trainer” ask the researcher for decision tree information as well when checking SMP, if SMP is generated with our tool?
